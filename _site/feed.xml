Sebelum saya membahas lebih lanjut perihal alasan pindah ke Linux, saya akan menjelaskan terlebih dahulu apa itu Linux. Mungkin teman teman disini ada yang belum paham apa sih Linux itu dan mengapa bisa menjadi alternatif selain Windows.
Linux merupakan operating system yang dikembangkan pertama kali oleh Linus Torvalds di tahun 1991. System ini berbasis open source sehingga dapat memudahkan pengguna atau developer lain berkontribusi dalam mengembangkan system Linux. Karena sifatnya yang open source, menjadikan Linux sebagai system operasi yang stabil, fleksibel, dan aman dari berbagai virus atau malware.</p>

<p>Linux banyak digunakan untuk berbagai kepentingan seperti misalnya pengembangan dan stabilitas server, software, bahkan juga untuk kebutuhan pribadi seperti komputer rumah, gaming dan hal lain yang bisa dilakukan.</p>

<p>Seiring dengan berkembangnya zaman Linux bersama pengembang saat ini sudah banyak mendistribusikan varian yang lebih banyak dan dikenal sebagai distro linux . Berikut ini adalah daftar distro linux yang sudah launching dan tersedia secara gratis di situs Linux.org :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu</li>
  <li>CentOs</li>
  <li>Debian</li>
  <li>Fedora</li>
  <li>Slackware</li>
  <li>Linux Mint</li>
  <li>Xubuntu</li>
  <li>Arch</li>
  <li>openSUSE</li>
  <li>RedHat</li>
  <li>Slackel</li>
  <li>PureOS</li>
  <li>Mageia</li>
  <li>PCLinuxOS</li>
  <li>Puppy</li>
  <li>ZorinOS</li>
  <li>Bunsenlabs</li>
  <li>Kubuntu</li>
  <li>Manjaro</li>
  <li>Neptune</li>
  <li>Bodhi</li>
  <li>Netrunner</li>
  <li>KaliLinux</li>
  <li>Lubuntu</li>
</ul>

<p>Dari daftar distro diatas mempunyai fungsi dan tujuan yang dapat disesuaikan dengan kebutuhan misal untuk pengguna yang baru ingin memulai, bisa mencoba Linux Mint, Ubuntu, atau ZorinOS. Yah, semua itu tentunya dapat dicoba jika anda penasaran.</p>

<p>Mengapa saya lebih memilih Linux Mint? Sebagai pengguna yang terbiasa dengan ekosistem windows pelan pelan saya mulai beradaptasi dan mencoba segala fiturnya, dan disini saya akan menjelasakan beberapa alasan mengapa lebih memilih Linux Mint.</p>

<h2 id="alasan-menggunakan-linux-mint">Alasan menggunakan Linux Mint</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tampilan yang lebih keren dan ringan</li>
  <li>Terdapat tiga pilihan edisi Cinnamon, Mate, dan XFCE</li>
  <li>Lebih aman dari virus</li>
  <li>Driver dan aplikasi terinstal otomatis</li>
  <li>Menu jelas dan tidak membingungkan</li>
  <li>Gratis</li>
</ul>

<p>Itulah beberapa alasan mengapa saya memilih Linux Mint untuk penggunaan harian, dan yang terpenting kita dapat menggunakan Os ini secara gratis tanpa bayar langganan apapun.</p>]]></content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alasan Menggunakan Linux Mint Setelah Migrasi dari Windows - Ok disini saya akan membagikan sedikit pengalaman pribadi mengapa lebih memilih Linux dan pindah dari Windows.

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>

<p>As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.</p>

<h2 id="special-formatting">Special formatting</h2>

<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>strike through</del></li>
  <li>==highlight==</li>
  <li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-code-blocks">Writing code blocks</h2>

<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/8.jpg" alt="walking" /></p>

<h2 id="reference-lists">Reference lists</h2>

<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>

<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

<h2 id="full-html">Full HTML</h2>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/3.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/3.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Press and education</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/press-and-education/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Press and education" /><published>2019-01-25T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2019-01-25T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/press-and-education</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/press-and-education/"><![CDATA[<p>Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p>

<p>Education must also train one for quick, <strong>resolute and effective thinking</strong>. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p>

<p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p>

<p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p>]]></content><author><name>sal</name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths.
